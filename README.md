# Cable Android

There is only one thing to say at the moment:
don't even think to submit this app for inclusion in F-Droid
or any other public repository. F-Droid inclusion is our ultimate
goal, but the project is totally not ready yet.

## Contributing

Signal's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is a good read. When submitting pull request please follow Signal's [Code-Style Guidelines](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines).

In general pull requests are welcome, have a look to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CableIM/Cable-Android/issues) to get some ideas of what has to be fixed or implemented. Keep in mind that we will diverge from Signal only when implementing (or removing) features because of the difference in design goals with Signal. Everything else has to be upstreamed.
