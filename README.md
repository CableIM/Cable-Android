# Cable

Cable is an encrypted communications application. It uses the Internet to
send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes,
images and videos, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. Cable uses
standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end
encryption to secure all communications to other Cable users. The
applications include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the
identity of their messaging correspondents and the integrity of the data
channel.

Cable is a fork of the popular Signal messaging app. It and aims to rely
on a distributed, federated and community managed network of servers.

Cable has been freed from the proprietary dependencies Signal has, it
does not use Google's Play Services and does not rely on the Google push
notification service.

## Get it

Not ready yet.

Don't even think to submit this app for inclusion in F-Droid
or any other public repository. F-Droid inclusion is our ultimate
goal, but the project is totally not ready yet.

## Contributing

Signal's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is a good read. When submitting pull request please follow Signal's [Code-Style Guidelines](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines).

In general pull requests are welcome, have a look at the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CableIM/Cable-Android/issues) to get some ideas of what has to be fixed or implemented. Keep in mind that we will diverge from Signal only when implementing (or removing) features because of the difference in design goals with Signal. Everything else has to be upstreamed.
